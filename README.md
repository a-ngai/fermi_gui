# How to build

The ui_form.py is generated through QT Creator; its project folder is currently located at "C:\Users\ngaia\Downloads\testing_qtcreator". This QT Creator project folder is ~0.5GB, so it will be left there.

With QT Creator, run "build" and "deploy", and that will generate the "ui_form.py". Copy and paste this to replace the beginning of the "main.py" file. The "main.py" file is made up of the "ui_form.py", and "mainwindow_for_ui_form.py" put together.

After generating "ui_form.py", copy the code from "mainwindow_for_ui_form.py" into  "ui_form.py", and then it will run.
